Stock Market Fantasy League is a game that applies fantasy sports mechanics to corporate earnings season. Instead of drafting athletes, players draft publicly traded companies and score points based on how those companies perform when they report earnings.

The goal is to make earnings season engaging, competitive, and educational—without real financial risk.

Earnings reports are one of the most important drivers of stock prices, yet they are often difficult to follow for non-experts. Key information (EPS beats, revenue surprises, guidance changes, and market reactions) is scattered across multiple sources and presented in a technical way.

This project transforms earnings season into a fantasy league where users:

- Draft companies before earnings season begins

- Compete against friends or public leagues

- Earn points based on objective, real-world earnings outcomes

- Learn which financial metrics drive valuation and market reaction
